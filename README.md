	Noughts and crosses Paper
My goal:
My goal is to make a program that can play noughts and crosses (tic tac toe) optimally. 
o	I cannot use any form of preprocessing.
o	It should run relatively fast.
o	It must be dynamic (it cannot be a series of if statements, this means it could be expanded to connect four more easily).
o	No external libraries should be used.
o	It must be my own idea (I cannot watch a video that details how to make a perfect tic tac toe script and take inspiration)
