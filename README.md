	Noughts and crosses Paper
My goal:
My goal is to make a program that can play noughts and crosses (tic tac toe) optimally. 
I cannot use any form of preprocessing.
It should run relatively fast.
It must be dynamic (it cannot be a series of if statements, this means it could be expanded to connect four more easily).
No external libraries should be used.
It must be my own idea (I cannot watch a video that details how to make a perfect tic tac toe script and take inspiration)
